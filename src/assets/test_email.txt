Hi there!,

I'm a jewelry designer and I'm looking for someone to help me make my designs come to life in gold.

I create digital design files and need a service that can:

3D print a model (like in wax or resin) directly from my design file.
Cast that model into gold.
Could you let me know if you offer this kind of service? I'd also appreciate any info on the types of gold you use, how long things usually take, and how you figure out costs.

Let me know if you need to see a sample of my design file.

Thanks a lot!

Best,
